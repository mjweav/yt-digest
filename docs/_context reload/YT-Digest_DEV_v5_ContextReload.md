# YT‑Digest • DEV Phase 5 • Context Reload (Post Patch 08 Run)
**Checkpoint:** Microstep 5.2b — post‑Patch‑08 fit run complete • 2025-10-10 00:33:44
**Purpose:** Load this in a fresh chat (after the global primer) to resume at analysis + final tuning planning.

---

## 0) Quick Start for the New Chat
1) Upload your global project primer (latest DEV v3 primer).
2) Upload this file (.md) and the companion machine capsule (.json).
3) Say: “Context loaded — resume at Microstep 5.2b; begin result analysis from Patch 08 fit run.”
4) We will proceed with the analysis checklist below, then plan Phase 6 (final tuning + integration).

---

## 1) Scope Recap (just enough for continuity)
YT‑Digest organizes YouTube subscriptions into topical umbrellas via a hybrid **Heuristics2** engine (weighted regex + term features) with **TF‑IDF fallback**. Phase 5’s objective has been to stabilize the automatic category assignment (umbrella taxonomy), repair drift (anchors.json, world_knowledge), and prepare the pipeline for final‑tuning (Phase 6) before wiring into the main app.

- **Current Engine in App:** Heuristics2 (still running)  
- **Fallback:** TF‑IDF cosine similarity ≥ 0.22 (configurable)  
- **Recent Concern Areas:**  
  - Loss of “world_knowledge” hits.
  - Over‑long umbrella labels (e.g., verbose Business/Tech names).
  - Umbrella count ceiling appearing hard‑capped ~10 (suspected constraint).
  - Music category over‑granularity — needs merge-down.

---

## 2) Environment & Key Paths
- `server/autoOrganize/heuristics2.js` (current engine logic; weighted features)
- `server/autoOrganize/builder.js` (pipeline coordinator; Phase 6 target for reintegration)
- `server/autoOrganize/autoOrganize.js` (or routes/entry) (exec surface)
- `data/autoOrganize.json` (latest classifications)
- `data/autoOrganize.debug.json` (explanations / per‑decision traces)
- `data/autoOrganize.meta.json` (run meta; counts, timing, thresholds)
- `data/anchors.json` (anchor lexicon / seed terms for umbrellas)
- `data/umbrella_map.json` (resolved umbrella keys → display labels)
- `data/stop_terms.json` (noise / timestamp terms to suppress)

> See the companion JSON for concrete values, knobs, and run flags captured at this checkpoint.

---

## 3) Engine Knobs (current working set)
- **Field Weights:** title=3.0, description=1.6, url=0.6
- **MIN_MARGIN (classification confidence):** 0.75 (delta over next best label)
- **TF‑IDF fallback:** cosine ≥ 0.22
- **Min token length / normalization:** std. lowercasing + punctuation trim; timestamp filter list applied
- **Umbrella label normalizer:** length guard + dash/colon truncation (see Patch 08 changes)

---

## 4) Patch 08 — Summary of Changes
**Goal:** Repair umbrella drift, remove unintended cap, restore “world_knowledge” signal, and tame verbose labels.

1. **anchors.json refresh & normalization**
   - Re‑hydrated anchor terms for under‑represented umbrellas (incl. `world_knowledge` set).
   - Applied diacritic/punctuation normalization; deduped and collapsed near‑synonyms.
   - Sorted anchors by priority and grouped into logical facets per umbrella.

2. **Umbrella expansion (removed implicit cap)**
   - Audited selection/aggregation path where top‑N umbrellas were previously truncated ~10.
   - Replaced hard/implicit limit with thresholded inclusion (score ≥ dynamic cutoff).
   - Ensured pagination/merging stages read full candidate set before pruning.

3. **Label hygiene & length guard**
   - Introduced concise label resolver: trims at separators (`—`, `–`, `:`, `·`) if verbose, keeps canonical short names.
   - Mapped long “business/technology” style strings to canonical umbrellas.

4. **Noise/timestamp filter**
   - Expanded stoplist to catch time‑stamps, episode numerals, and routine boilerplate phrases leaking into tokens.

5. **Minor heuristic fixes**
   - Tie‑break preference tweaks favor exact‑anchor hits over weak multi‑term TF‑IDF.
   - Added safe floor on negative evidence so one off‑topic term cannot wipe a strong positive match.

**Expected Outcomes of Patch 08 fit run:**
- `world_knowledge` assignments should reappear where context warrants.
- More than 10 umbrellas can surface where justified by scores.
- Label set should appear cleaner/shorter on output artifacts.
- Music sub‑clusters still present but flagged for Phase 6 merge policy.

---

## 5) Latest Run Artifacts (what to open)
- **Primary:** `data/autoOrganize.json`
- **Diagnostics:** `data/autoOrganize.debug.json`
- **Meta:** `data/autoOrganize.meta.json`
- **Taxonomy:** `data/anchors.json`, `data/umbrella_map.json`

Focus the review on:
- Umbrella count (no artificial cap).
- Presence/absence of `world_knowledge` hits.
- Any remaining long labels.
- Music umbrella consolidation candidates (merge-down list).

---

## 6) Analysis Checklist (use in the new chat)
1. **Umbrella Cardinality Check**: Confirm >10 umbrellas appear where expected; list top 15 by channel count.
2. **World Knowledge Restoration**: Diff pre‑Patch‑08 vs post for `world_knowledge` frequency; sample 10 channels.
3. **Label Audit**: Extract unique labels; flag >40 chars or with 2+ separators for map cleanup.
4. **Music Merge Plan**: Propose 2–3 target umbrellas and re‑route sub‑clusters; quantify channel movements.
5. **Edge Cases**: Identify any channels mis‑routed due to timestamp/noise tokens (spot‑check from debug file).
6. **Thresholds Sensitivity**: Simulate ±0.05 on cosine and ±0.05 on MIN_MARGIN using debug scores (no code change yet; plan).
7. **Performance Snapshot**: Capture avg decision latency and top 5 heaviest steps from meta for future optimization.

## 7) Phase 6 (Next Phase) Plan — Final Tuning & Integration
**Objective:** Achieve “good enough” classification quality to replace **Heuristics2** in the **main app**, while keeping the door open for future AI optimizations.

### Streams
A. **Quality Tuning**
- Finalize weights, MIN_MARGIN, and fallback thresholds.
- Formalize **merge policies** (e.g., Music consolidation, long‑tail umbrellas).
- Lock canonical label map.

B. **Pipeline Integration**
- Re‑enter the main pipeline (`builder.js`) with a clean **Classifier module** interface.
- Convert batch scripts → first‑class modules; keep debug hooks (feature flags).

C. **Deployability (Render/Vercel)**
- Isolate pure Node module (no dev‑only deps).
- Externalize config via env vars.
- Add health/readiness routes; slim artifacts and cold‑start footprint.

D. **Observability**
- Lightweight per‑decision trace (sampled); counters for label distribution drift.
- Switchable log level controlled by env.

E. **AI Optimization (post‑replace)**
- Optional reranker for “uncertain” cases only (budget‑aware).
- Cache TF‑IDF vectors and precompute frequent channels.

---

## 8) Next‑Chat Startup Instructions
- State: “Resume at **Microstep 5.2b**; begin Analysis Checklist step 1.”
- Provide/attach `autoOrganize.json`, `autoOrganize.debug.json`, `autoOrganize.meta.json` if not already in the repo context.
- We will produce:
  - `label_audit.report.md`
  - `merge_plan.music.md`
  - `threshold_sensitivity.plan.md`
  - `phase6_integration.spec.md`

---

## 9) Open Questions to Resolve Early in Phase 6
- Confirm production target: Render vs Vercel (affects process model and timeouts).
- Decide on minimum viable observability package (log schema + sampling rate).
- Clarify acceptance thresholds for “good enough” (precision/recall proxy via manual spot checks).

---

## 10) Hand‑off Notes
- The main app **still runs Heuristics2**; replacement will occur after Phase 6 acceptance.
- Keep a feature flag to switch between engines for safe rollout (A/B toggle).
