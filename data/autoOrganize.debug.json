Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  \n\nI get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!\n\nIf you’re a law student or thinking about law school, check out my other channel made specifically for law students and 0Ls here: https://goo.gl/e3kEHL",

What could you possibly have to say?\"\n\nThese were the actual words that an author said to me after I asked them for help when I was still an aspiring author. TO. MY. FACE. \n\nDid I let her negative words get me down? At first, yes. But then I dusted myself off, refocused on self-publishing my books, Googled every question I had, learned from some mistakes, and now I have 9 books out under my own name and help aspiring authors like you realize that full title!\n\nIf you have a question about writing, self-publishing, or promoting your books please send it to me and I will answer it on my channel. I post new videos every Wednesday and sometimes I post a few extra surprise videos too, so be sure to subscribe! \n\nThanks for tuning in! Now get back to writing your book! :)",

From the beginning, the duo of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith were tackling big subjects -- their very name derived from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy, and his theories were evident throughout their debut, The Hurting. Driven by catchy, infectious synth pop, The Hurting became a big hit in their native England, setting the stage for international stardom with their second album, 1985's Songs From the Big Chair. \n\nOn the strength of the singles \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout,\" the record became a major hit, establishing the duo as one of the leading acts of the second generation of MTV stars.",

I'm Randall Carlson, and for over five decades I've studied the hidden patterns of nature, the cataclysms that have shaped our past, and the sacred architecture that encodes timeless truths.\n\nThis channel is a portal into that exploration.\n\nYou'll find episodes of Squaring the Circle, where I delve into the geometry of the cosmos, the rhythms of Earth, and the deep-time perspective often missing from modern discourse. You'll also discover The Big Picture with Becket Fusik, where we engage in wide-ranging conversations about humanity’s forgotten legacy and the cycles that govern civilization itself.\n\nIf you’re drawn to the mysteries of the past, the elegance of sacred geometry, and the possibility of a greater pattern unfolding through time—then you’re in the right place.",

          "desc": "The Wellermen’s history is well-known: originators of the sea shanty trend on Tiktok, they’ve since gone from strength to strength. Their versions of ‘Misty Mountains’, ‘Nancy Mulligan’, and ‘Hoist The Colours’ have racked up billions of views & led them to appearances on shows like Ant and Dec, Last Week Tonight, The Colbert Show & more. The group have now returned with their new album ‘Northern Sky’. Among much-loved traditionals such as ‘Wild Mountain Thyme’, ‘Amazing Grace’, and ‘Red Is The Rose’, you will find more modern songs such as Johnny Cash ‘Hurt’ & a lively version of ‘The Nights'. The band also present originals ‘Northern Sky’ inspired by maritime life in the Hebrides in the 18th century, and the humorous ‘Tall Tales’ - a one-upmanship of the telling of wild sea adventures. Say the Wellermen: “It’s all about connection and storytelling, and we hope the listeners are able to find something meaningful.” One thing is certain: these talented men are in it for the long haul.",

I created this channel to educate the RV community by showing tips & tricks, upgrades & modifications, plus repairs & maintenance we've performed on our RVs over the years.  We want to help you understand the different processes involved with owning and operating an RV, whether its a travel trailer, 5th wheel, toy hauler, motorhome or pop up camper.  We'll show you the products we love and how to use them.  If you want to get the most from our channel, please subscribe and turn on all notifications so you're alerted when we release new videos.  Thanks for watching!\n\n*Always check with manufacturer warranties before installing any aftermarket equipment on your RV. It's equally important to keep records of all service & maintenance performed on your RV for warranty purposes.",

A married couple that decided to cash in all our chips by selling our house & all our stuff to become full time traveling nomads, living in our RV, a 2012 Winnebago Vista 35F Motorhome.\n\nWe took 18 months to make all these changes & prepare our motorhome to travel around the country. Youtube & other online resources—helped us prepare for RV living & traveling.\n\nAs a Purple Heart Veteran with a unique mechanical back ground & life experiences—along with Joanie his wife—his sole camera person—has given Martin the freedom, discipline & confidence to empower other RVer's to tackle the jobs they once were afraid to do themselves.\n\nOur goal is to help other RVer's. Not build a Youtube empire.\n\nHave questions? Hit me up on Facebook Messenger.\n\nWe hope to see many of you on the road.",

Build my own traditional off grid log cabin by hand from the materials of the Swedish wilderness. Just like our ancestors.\n\nI had no previous experience in building, gathering materials or filming. So I started studying myself the old arts and learning from my grandfather. I began to cut down trees and film with my phone, learning as I go. My project started full time once I graduated high school in summer 2019. I film everything myself and edit these videos so you can follow my journey and hopefully learn as I do.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSubscribe to follow my journey.\n\nMy own hand made products: https://www.grankvist-outdoors.com/\n\nMy exclusive Youtube membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxByVUuLdxxiqQVmbOnDEzw/join\n\nInstagram: @erikgrankvist_\n\nBusiness contact: hawta@grankvist-outdoors.com",

One day I quit, cold turkey.\n\nWithin 5 years my real estate business surpassed $100 million annually.\n\nHow did I see such explosive growth? \n\n1.) Building the most trusted YouTube for Real Estate brand \"CHANNEL JUNKIES\" in the real estate industry and leaning into it. \n\n2.) Aligning with a brokerage that shared our vision and goals. I was reluctant to explore eXp Realty before we made the move because my EGO made me think I knew what was best.... \n\nSince our specialty is YouTube, I wanted to create a YouTube channel that realtors can get real information without feeling the pressure of being recruited.\n\nIf you do have further question about eXp Realty, feel free to book a private session:\n\nBOOK A LIVE ZOOM CALL HERE W/ JESSE (YES ITS ME) 📲 https://calendly.com/jessedau/expzoom\n\neXp\nLicense# 201222305",

My team has deployed probes into tornadoes using drones, small aircraft, and even rockets, gathering measurements never-before-recorded on earth. Documenting all things related to atmospheric science is my passion.\n\nI’ve been featured on the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, Netflix, The Weather Channel, Disney, PBS, AccuWeather and more!

          "desc": "I started with a single dime. \n\n$24,000 in debt, stressed out in my marriage, and sick of spending my days building someone else's dream, I felt purposeless, tired, and unfulfilled. One day I had enough, fired Apple, and became my own boss. \n\nPeople laughed and thought I was crazy. But I refused to give up. Through millions of failures along the way, I turned a single dime into $104,857.60. Today, a self made millionaire, I have five passive income streams that free me to spend time with the people I love and go on adventures I never could before. \n\n💪 If you are dead serious about creating cash flow and having margin to do the things you love with the people you love, I and my team of bad ass coaches can help. 💪\n\nWe are a growing network of entrepreneurs in 90+ countries, impacting the world by helping those in need, investing in opportunities and new ideas, creating wealth, and living a life of meaning. \n\n🔥 Apply for a free consultation 👉 https://jod.com/apply",

Check it out at- https://crunchlabs.com\n2) I studied Mechanical Engineering in School.  I did my undergrad at BYU and Masters at USC.\n3) I worked for NASA JPL for 9 years, 7 of which were working on the Curiosity Rover (I made a video about it you should def totes watch cause it's probably my favorite of all my videos).  Then I made some Halloween costumes.  Then I worked for Apple in their Special Projects Group doing Product Design as a Mechanical Engineer for 5 years. Then in 2022 I created CrunchLabs to deliver monthly toys that teach you to think like an engineer.",

We wish we had the opportunity to use other systems such as Final Cut X. This baffles most of our friends and peers and we are often met with blank stares. We're here to piggy back on the great contributions of Mike Matzdorff and Michael Yanovich's channel, UNAUTHORIZED FCPX. Our channel is here to help explain what appeals to us about Final Cut and to maybe help any Avid users who are curious. It's basically Final Cut Pro X for Avid users. Be on the lookout for future brief tutorials and demos in the future. When we have time to make something we'll put it up here.\n\nThanks for visiting and be sure to check out UNAUTHORIZED FCPX for one of the best overviews of Final Cut! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFm0z5RkLU2rEd4TTRst_A",

          "desc": "I‘m Martin Miller, a musician from Leipzig, Germany, born in 1985. I‘ve been a professional musician my entire adult life. In 2010 I graduated from Carl-Maria-von-Weber Music College in Dresden as a guitar player and music educator. I‘ve also been teaching the guitar bachelor's and master's courses myself there from 2015 to 2020.\n\nOver the past decade, I‘ve made a name for myself as a guitar player (toured dozens of countries worldwide, played on tons of records), Youtuber (580.000+ YT subscribers, 100+ million views) and author (best-selling online courses on JTC Guitar). This has led to the creation of two worldwide distributed and highly succesful Martin Miller signature guitars with Ibanez – the MM1 and MM7.\n\nI‘m also the band leader of the Martin Miller Session Band, a Youtube cover project that comes together a few times a year to record together. We collaborated with artists such as Paul Gilbert, Andy Timmons, Mark Lettieri (Snarky Puppy) and many more.",

'Love Remains' “documents [Tal’s] facility as a songwriter and a rich, expressive singer whose voice brings a fluid kind of cohesion” (Billboard), & critics say the album is “outstanding by all accounts” (Paste).\n\nWith few models of an instrumentalist turned singer-songwriter, Tal has broken extraordinary new ground. As Jackson Browne acknowledged, “I can't think of another instrumentalist that has ventured into the area that Tal now has, when it comes to writing and singing songs from her own experience.”\n\nHaving performed as a bassist with Jeff Beck, Mick Jagger, Prince, The Allman Bros, Herbie Hancock, & many more, Tal’s experiences playing with the greats has inspired her to hone her craft as an artist in her own right.",

But music is what we're most passionate about and we work really hard and spend a lot of time every week learning songs and getting better as musicians. \n\nWe will continue to get better and we would be honored if you would continue to listen and follow our journey!!!\n\nA few people have asked us to set up links for them to show their appreciation for the music.

I have an amazing team of teachers teaching with me in the Manhattan/Tri-State/Philedelphia area. We do in-person lessons out here, but we have an online community of voice students from all over the world. If you need a vocal coach, shoot us a message on the website. \n\nPrevious to teaching, I worked as a singer in Opera/Musical Theatre/Pop/Rock and Jazz styles. Nowadays, I've been exploring more experimental vocal uses in a couple different projects, mostly involved with electronic music/ambient house music & looping. I've also recently found I have a lot of passion for learning beatboxing techniques as well as deepening my coordinations in heavy metal vocal usage.",

I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. \n\nNow, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  \nI only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.\n\nLet’s GROW!",

I also make tutorials on How-to harvest seeds from food waste and grow many things from start to finish. This Channel started after I built a Potting Shed for my Grandad using 100% FREE reclaimed and salvaged materials. Unfortunately he suffered a Stroke during the making of that build so I have taken it upon myself to create a Garden he'd always dreamt of.\n​\n​With no previous training or trying these projects before. I'm basically using a little Common Sense and Learning as I go, so come on this Journey with me and Subscribe today.\n\n► Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/projectdiaries\n► Paypal Donations: https://www.paypal.me/projectdiaries\n► Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/projectdiaries\n\nENJOY!! & THANKS FOR DROPPING BY.",

Gardening doesn't have to be hard, and you don't have to be a servant to the garden. I can help you too create a gardening system that works with you and for you rather then you working for it. I use No pesticides, No herbicides. No fungicides, No growth hormones, No antibiotics, and No fertilizers. I allow nature to be the teacher and mimic the natural forest model to create an ideal living environment for all living things. I know their aren't a lot of people who are super excited about growing their own food, but at a time when GMO's and pesticide laden foods are causing so many health problems, I am standing in the gap showing others there is a different, and a better way!",

I've been a photographer since 2007, a photography blogger since 2009.  I use 360 cameras and other action cams.  \n\nI have been writing about 360 cameras and VR since February 2016 on 360rumors.com, with over 3000 articles as of July 2023. In 2016, I was the first to blog about a little company called Insta360 no one knew about 🙂. In April 2020, I was the first to show the invisible flying camera effect.",

I want to share with you what I've learned about what's ahead: the upsides, the risks, and why we can't afford to put off thinking about them.\n\nThis show is produced by 80,000 Hours, a nonprofit that helps people figure out how to use their time to make the transition to a world with AGI go well.",

Real change has nothing to do with complicated productivity hacks or perfect 5AM routines.\n\nIt’s not about becoming someone else… it’s about unlocking the 2.0 version of you that’s already inside, waiting to be set free.\nBecause when you shift who you are, everything else—your confidence, relationships, and career—falls into place.\n\nReady to step into your 2.0 self? \n\nLet’s make it happen for you 👊",

      "desc": "Hey! My name is Jesse Dau and I am a licensed Real Estate Agent & Team Leader with eXp Realty.\n\nBefore real estate, I spent 15 years in Corporate America. One day I quit, cold turkey.\n\nWithin 5 years my real estate business surpassed $100 million annually.\n\nHow did I see such explosive growth? \n\n1.) Building the most trusted YouTube for Real Estate brand \"CHANNEL JUNKIES\" in the real estate industry and leaning into it. \n\n2.) Aligning with a brokerage that shared our vision and goals. I was reluctant to explore eXp Realty before we made the move because my EGO made me think I knew what was best.... \n\nSince our specialty is YouTube, I wanted to create a YouTube channel that realtors can get real information without feeling the pressure of being recruited.\n\nIf you do have further question about eXp Realty, feel free to book a private session:\n\nBOOK A LIVE ZOOM CALL HERE W/ JESSE (YES ITS ME) 📲 https://calendly.com/jessedau/expzoom\n\neXp\nLicense# 201222305",

I'm currently looking at a different industry which has much greater growth potential. But don't worry I still love cameras and I'm still actively making videos. It's just harder to make a living making from YouTube when YouTube's algorithm doesn't seem to like my videos anymore.

Build my own traditional off grid log cabin by hand from the materials of the Swedish wilderness. Just like our ancestors.\n\nI had no previous experience in building, gathering materials or filming. So I started studying myself the old arts and learning from my grandfather. I began to cut down trees and film with my phone, learning as I go. My project started full time once I graduated high school in summer 2019. I film everything myself and edit these videos so you can follow my journey and hopefully learn as I do.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nSubscribe to follow my journey.\n\nMy own hand made products: https://www.grankvist-outdoors.com/\n\nMy exclusive Youtube membership: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxByVUuLdxxiqQVmbOnDEzw/join\n\nInstagram: @erikgrankvist_\n\nBusiness contact: hawta@grankvist-outdoors.com",

We wish we had the opportunity to use other systems such as Final Cut X. This baffles most of our friends and peers and we are often met with blank stares. We're here to piggy back on the great contributions of Mike Matzdorff and Michael Yanovich's channel, UNAUTHORIZED FCPX. Our channel is here to help explain what appeals to us about Final Cut and to maybe help any Avid users who are curious. It's basically Final Cut Pro X for Avid users. Be on the lookout for future brief tutorials and demos in the future. When we have time to make something we'll put it up here.\n\nThanks for visiting and be sure to check out UNAUTHORIZED FCPX for one of the best overviews of Final Cut! https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgFm0z5RkLU2rEd4TTRst_A",

In the real world, I've started a few companies, I wrote \"The World Atlas of Coffee\" and \"How To Make The Best Coffee At Home\". I do a little advisory work for startups too.\n\nIf you want to get in touch, drop me a line but please read these two things first:\n\n1. I don't do paid reviews. I have a Patreon that helps me buy the products I want to review to prevent bias (then I give them away!)\n2.

In fact, I've been teaching people how to garden for over 15 years on TV as the host of 3 national gardening shows ( DIY Network & PBS). My current show - Emmy Award-winning Growing a Greener World is in its 9th season\n\nBut my real passion is in teaching people about organic gardening & how to be better, smarter gardeners through short how-to videos like these. No matter where you are in your gardening journey, from an experienced veteran or you're just getting started, if you'd like to grow like a pro, you've come to the right place. I'll be adding new videos every week. \n\nThanks for stopping by.  \nJoe Lamp'l (the \"joe\" behind joe gardener). \n\nP.S.

Have some fun and learn to think like a lawyer.  \n\nI get asked a lot about whether being a practicing attorney is like being a lawyer on TV.  I love watching legal movies and courtroom dramas.  It's one of the reasons I decided to become a lawyer.  But sometimes they make me want to pull my hair out because they are ridiculous.  So I created this channel to answer your burning questions about the law and the legal profession.  While all legal movies and shows take dramatic license to make things more interesting (nobody wants to see hundreds of hours of brief writing), many of them have a grain of truth.  Learn everything you always wanted to know about being an attorney!\n\nIf you’re a law student or thinking about law school, check out my other channel made specifically for law students and 0Ls here: https://goo.gl/e3kEHL",

Founded in 2008 as an outlet for my passion for products, LisaSz09 quickly became a place to help others find their Style & Confidence in themselves.  \nMy mission is to help the Over 40 woman find items that make her feel amazing in her own skin. Through testing products & trying on new fashion to create outfits for your everyday life, no matter what that may look like. \nI was born & raised in the small (1st) state of Delaware, I grew up as a tomboy who also had a love of taking risks & trying new things.\nAfter moving to Maryland in 2001 I spent years working in various forms of marketing careers, however after marrying my husband (Marty) & having my son (MJ) I made the decision to focus my marketing background in to creating online content to help other women.\nI am now focusing on helping the over 40 woman who is not your typical size 0 find products and fashion they love!\nCheers- Lisa",

I‘ve also been teaching the guitar bachelor's and master's courses myself there from 2015 to 2020.\n\nOver the past decade, I‘ve made a name for myself as a guitar player (toured dozens of countries worldwide, played on tons of records), Youtuber (580.000+ YT subscribers, 100+ million views) and author (best-selling online courses on JTC Guitar). This has led to the creation of two worldwide distributed and highly succesful Martin Miller signature guitars with Ibanez – the MM1 and MM7.\n\nI‘m also the band leader of the Martin Miller Session Band, a Youtube cover project that comes together a few times a year to record together. We collaborated with artists such as Paul Gilbert, Andy Timmons, Mark Lettieri (Snarky Puppy) and many more.",

MedCram was founded in 2012 by Dr. Roger Seheult and one of his former PA students, Kyle Allred, with one word in mind: CLARITY\n\nJoin over 1,500,000 clinicians and students who’ve utilized MedCram to:\n- Become a better clinician\n- Score better on exams\n- Cut down on study time \n- Get CME, CE, MOC points (over 60 hours)\n\nMedCram = More Clarity, in Less Time\n\nMedia Contact: see email below",

I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. \n\nNow, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  \nI only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.\n\nLet’s GROW!",

I make money with AI & teach others how they can too.\n\nI'm not the best in the world, nor are my accomplishments the most impressive... but some people think I have interesting things to say!

I also make tutorials on How-to harvest seeds from food waste and grow many things from start to finish. This Channel started after I built a Potting Shed for my Grandad using 100% FREE reclaimed and salvaged materials. Unfortunately he suffered a Stroke during the making of that build so I have taken it upon myself to create a Garden he'd always dreamt of.\n​\n​With no previous training or trying these projects before. I'm basically using a little Common Sense and Learning as I go, so come on this Journey with me and Subscribe today.\n\n► Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/projectdiaries\n► Paypal Donations: https://www.paypal.me/projectdiaries\n► Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/projectdiaries\n\nENJOY!! & THANKS FOR DROPPING BY.",

My team has deployed probes into tornadoes using drones, small aircraft, and even rockets, gathering measurements never-before-recorded on earth. Documenting all things related to atmospheric science is my passion.\n\nI’ve been featured on the Discovery Channel, National Geographic, Netflix, The Weather Channel, Disney, PBS, AccuWeather and more! I’ve been featured on Jay Leno’s Garage, and worked with the legendary Richard Hammond, from Top Gear & Grand Tour. It’s insane where my weather career has taken me.",

I created this channel to educate the RV community by showing tips & tricks, upgrades & modifications, plus repairs & maintenance we've performed on our RVs over the years.  We want to help you understand the different processes involved with owning and operating an RV, whether its a travel trailer, 5th wheel, toy hauler, motorhome or pop up camper.  We'll show you the products we love and how to use them.  If you want to get the most from our channel, please subscribe and turn on all notifications so you're alerted when we release new videos.  Thanks for watching!\n\n*Always check with manufacturer warranties before installing any aftermarket equipment on your RV. It's equally important to keep records of all service & maintenance performed on your RV for warranty purposes.",

A married couple that decided to cash in all our chips by selling our house & all our stuff to become full time traveling nomads, living in our RV, a 2012 Winnebago Vista 35F Motorhome.\n\nWe took 18 months to make all these changes & prepare our motorhome to travel around the country. Youtube & other online resources—helped us prepare for RV living & traveling.\n\nAs a Purple Heart Veteran with a unique mechanical back ground & life experiences—along with Joanie his wife—his sole camera person—has given Martin the freedom, discipline & confidence to empower other RVer's to tackle the jobs they once were afraid to do themselves.\n\nOur goal is to help other RVer's. Not build a Youtube empire.\n\nHave questions? Hit me up on Facebook Messenger.\n\nWe hope to see many of you on the road.",

My goal is to do the same for as many people as possible by exposing them to the joy of engineering, fabricating and creating things out of nothing.

'Love Remains' “documents [Tal’s] facility as a songwriter and a rich, expressive singer whose voice brings a fluid kind of cohesion” (Billboard), & critics say the album is “outstanding by all accounts” (Paste).\n\nWith few models of an instrumentalist turned singer-songwriter, Tal has broken extraordinary new ground. As Jackson Browne acknowledged, “I can't think of another instrumentalist that has ventured into the area that Tal now has, when it comes to writing and singing songs from her own experience.”\n\nHaving performed as a bassist with Jeff Beck, Mick Jagger, Prince, The Allman Bros, Herbie Hancock, & many more, Tal’s experiences playing with the greats has inspired her to hone her craft as an artist in her own right.",

      "desc": "Tears for Fears were always more ambitious than the average synth pop group. From the beginning, the duo of Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith were tackling big subjects -- their very name derived from Arthur Janov's primal scream therapy, and his theories were evident throughout their debut, The Hurting. Driven by catchy, infectious synth pop, The Hurting became a big hit in their native England, setting the stage for international stardom with their second album, 1985's Songs From the Big Chair. \n\nOn the strength of the singles \"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\" and \"Shout,\" the record became a major hit, establishing the duo as one of the leading acts of the second generation of MTV stars.",

I use No pesticides, No herbicides. No fungicides, No growth hormones, No antibiotics, and No fertilizers. I allow nature to be the teacher and mimic the natural forest model to create an ideal living environment for all living things. I know their aren't a lot of people who are super excited about growing their own food, but at a time when GMO's and pesticide laden foods are causing so many health problems, I am standing in the gap showing others there is a different, and a better way!",

We LOVE 70s and 80s music but we also do more current songs. We love lots of different styles of music :)\n\nWe go to school, do sports, climb trees and run around. But music is what we're most passionate about and we work really hard and spend a lot of time every week learning songs and getting better as musicians. \n\nWe will continue to get better and we would be honored if you would continue to listen and follow our journey!!!\n\nA few people have asked us to set up links for them to show their appreciation for the music. For them, we have set up the links below. For them and for you all:  we're thrilled that you are enjoying the music! \n\nIf you wish to send us mail, our mailing address is PO Box 24021, San Jose, CA. 95154",

      "desc": "Welcome. Here, we explore the profound mysteries of our world—where science, symbolism, and ancient wisdom converge. I'm Randall Carlson, and for over five decades I've studied the hidden patterns of nature, the cataclysms that have shaped our past, and the sacred architecture that encodes timeless truths.\n\nThis channel is a portal into that exploration.\n\nYou'll find episodes of Squaring the Circle, where I delve into the geometry of the cosmos, the rhythms of Earth, and the deep-time perspective often missing from modern discourse. You'll also discover The Big Picture with Becket Fusik, where we engage in wide-ranging conversations about humanity’s forgotten legacy and the cycles that govern civilization itself.\n\nIf you’re drawn to the mysteries of the past, the elegance of sacred geometry, and the possibility of a greater pattern unfolding through time—then you’re in the right place.",

Their versions of ‘Misty Mountains’, ‘Nancy Mulligan’, and ‘Hoist The Colours’ have racked up billions of views & led them to appearances on shows like Ant and Dec, Last Week Tonight, The Colbert Show & more. The group have now returned with their new album ‘Northern Sky’. Among much-loved traditionals such as ‘Wild Mountain Thyme’, ‘Amazing Grace’, and ‘Red Is The Rose’, you will find more modern songs such as Johnny Cash ‘Hurt’ & a lively version of ‘The Nights'. The band also present originals ‘Northern Sky’ inspired by maritime life in the Hebrides in the 18th century, and the humorous ‘Tall Tales’ - a one-upmanship of the telling of wild sea adventures. Say the Wellermen: “It’s all about connection and storytelling, and we hope the listeners are able to find something meaningful.” One thing is certain: these talented men are in it for the long haul.",

I have an amazing team of teachers teaching with me in the Manhattan/Tri-State/Philedelphia area. We do in-person lessons out here, but we have an online community of voice students from all over the world. If you need a vocal coach, shoot us a message on the website. \n\nPrevious to teaching, I worked as a singer in Opera/Musical Theatre/Pop/Rock and Jazz styles. Nowadays, I've been exploring more experimental vocal uses in a couple different projects, mostly involved with electronic music/ambient house music & looping. I've also recently found I have a lot of passion for learning beatboxing techniques as well as deepening my coordinations in heavy metal vocal usage.",
