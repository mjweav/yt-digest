When I was 18 years old I ventured out alone with only a backpack full of simple hand tools to actualize my dream. Build my own traditional off grid log cabin by hand from the materials of the Swedish wilderness. Just like our ancestors.

I had no previous experience in building, gathering materials or filming. So I started studying myself the old arts and learning from my grandfather. I began to cut down trees and film with my phone, learning as I go. My project started full time once I graduated high school in summer 2019. I film everything myself and edit these videos so you can follow my journey and hopefully learn as I do.

Before real estate, I spent 15 years in Corporate America. One day I quit, cold turkey.

Within 5 years my real estate business surpassed $100 million annually.

How did I see such explosive growth? 

1.) Building the most trusted YouTube for Real Estate brand ""CHANNEL JUNKIES"" in the real estate industry and leaning into it. 

2.) Aligning with a brokerage that shared our vision and goals. I was reluctant to explore eXp Realty before we made the move because my EGO made me think I knew what was best.... 

Since our specialty is YouTube, I wanted to create a YouTube channel that realtors can get real information without feeling the pressure of being recruited.

‚Äã
Project Diaries is an ever growing Gardening Community and information Youtube Channel based on projects I've done or have been interested in doing as Hobbies using free, very cheap or recycled materials. I also make tutorials on How-to harvest seeds from food waste and grow many things from start to finish. This Channel started after I built a Potting Shed for my Grandad using 100% FREE reclaimed and salvaged materials. Unfortunately he suffered a Stroke during the making of that build so I have taken it upon myself to create a Garden he'd always dreamt of.
‚Äã
‚ÄãWith no previous training or trying these projects before. I'm basically using a little Common Sense and Learning as I go, so come on this Journey with me and Subscribe today.

UCcJceGUaevGlP7s2xzL9akA,Next Level Gardening,Gardening,19.6,27.6,8,"If you‚Äôre a beginning gardener or someone who has been growing food and flowers for years,  I will help you take your gardening expertise to the next level and have fun doing it.

I've been gardening for 30 years, 10 of which I was mentored by a University of California Certified Master Gardener.  

I don‚Äôt just love gardening, it is my passion and other than my family and friends, it is my life.  I wake up thinking about it and go to sleep thinking about it. Sometimes it keeps me up at night thinking about new and better ways of growing organically. 

Now, in my 30th year of gardening,  I am going to use YouTube to pass on the gift of inspiration and knowledge that I was freely given three decades ago by an amazing gardener who probably never knew just how important a role she played in my life.  
I only hope I can help you discover what a life-changing past-time gardening can be.

Let‚Äôs GROW!"
