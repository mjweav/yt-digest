Before real estate, I spent 15 years in Corporate America. One day I quit, cold turkey.

How did I see such explosive growth? 

1.) Building the most trusted YouTube for Real Estate brand ""CHANNEL JUNKIES"" in the real estate industry and leaning into it. 

2.) Aligning with a brokerage that shared our vision and goals. I was reluctant to explore eXp Realty before we made the move because my EGO made me think I knew what was best.... 

Since our specialty is YouTube, I wanted to create a YouTube channel that realtors can get real information without feeling the pressure of being recruited.

My mission is to help the Over 40 woman find items that make her feel amazing in her own skin. Through testing products & trying on new fashion to create outfits for your everyday life, no matter what that may look like. 
I was born & raised in the small (1st) state of Delaware, I grew up as a tomboy who also had a love of taking risks & trying new things.
After moving to Maryland in 2001 I spent years working in various forms of marketing careers, however after marrying my husband (Marty) & having my son (MJ) I made the decision to focus my marketing background in to creating online content to help other women.
I am now focusing on helping the over 40 woman who is not your typical size 0 find products and fashion they love!
